Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods,tools to the develooment and maintenance of high-quality software systems.It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life,including communication,commerce,entertainment and healthcare. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The development of programming languages  i.e Fortan
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structure programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

-Requirement;Gathering and documenting user needs. 
-Design;Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture.
-Implementation;writing codes and building the software according to design 
-Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards.
-Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
-Maintenance: Fix issues and update the software post release.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach with distinct phases e.g requirement,design
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility ,collaboration and responding to change.
-Waterfall is rigid and sequential; Agile is flexible and iterative.
-Waterfall is documentation-heavy; Agile focuses on working software and collaboration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software developer-responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
-Quality Assurance Engineer-Ensures software quality by designing and exece duting test plans.
-Project Manager;They oversee the planning,execution and delivery of software products
-System Architect;Designs the overall structure and architecture of software systems.
-UI/UX;Creates user interface and designs user experiences.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code e.g Eclipse
-VCs software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Tight Deadline pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality
-Changing requirement;Requirement may change during the develpment cycle,leading to scope creep and project delays.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing ;Testing individual components or modules of software.
-Intergration; Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
-System Testing;Testing the entire software system as a whole
-Acceptance Testing;Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from Al models.It helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific ,so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

"Can you help me with my project?"
"Can you review the first draft of my report on sustainable energy and provide feedback."
The improved prompt is more effective because it speci
